# CS210-Portfolio: CornerGrocer Project

This repository contains my **CornerGrocer project** for CS 210. The project demonstrates my ability to write well-documented and readable C++ code, design functional programs, and solve real-world problems using programming concepts.

## Project Summary
The CornerGrocer project simulates a grocery store checkout system. It allows users to manage inventory, process customer purchases, and track sales. The program solves the problem of efficiently handling transactions and inventory management in a small retail environment, providing a simple but functional solution for store operations.

## What I Did Well
I implemented modular code with clearly defined functions and classes to separate responsibilities. I focused on readability and maintainability by using meaningful variable names, consistent indentation, and comments to explain the purpose of key sections. I successfully implemented core functionality such as adding items, calculating totals, and displaying receipts in an organized manner.

## Areas for Improvement
While the project functions correctly, some parts could be optimized. For example, searching the inventory could be made more efficient by using better data structures like unordered_map instead of looping through vectors. Error handling for invalid input could also be enhanced to make the program more secure and user-friendly.

## Challenging Parts and Solutions
The most challenging part was implementing the inventory management and ensuring all functions updated the data correctly. I overcame this by carefully planning the data structures and testing each function independently before integrating them. I also referred to C++ documentation and online forums to clarify syntax and best practices.

## Transferable Skills
This project strengthened my object-oriented programming skills, problem-solving, and debugging techniques. These skills will be useful in future C++ projects and any programming task that requires careful planning, modular design, and efficient code.

## Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
I made the program maintainable by organizing code into functions and classes, and by using comments and consistent formatting. Readability was enhanced through descriptive names and structured output. The program is adaptable because additional features, such as new inventory actions or discount calculations, can be added without major restructuring.
